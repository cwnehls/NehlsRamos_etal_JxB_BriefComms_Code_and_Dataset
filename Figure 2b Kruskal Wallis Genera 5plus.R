# Kruskal Wallis Analyses for Genera with 5 or More Data Points
# Date of last edit: 12/11/2025
# Description: This code is meant to be ran altogther at once. This code is made to analyse 
  # the variation of Rubisco dark inhibition across flowering plant genera. Optional 
  # tests for normality and variation are included. This code uses the Kruskal-Wallis paired  
  # with Dunn test and compact letter display (cld) to produce a plot of the variation of
  # Rubisco dark inhibition, colored by order. only cld results and box plots are shown
  # for orders with 5 or more data points. For all others only the median is shown. Genera  
  # are ordered by phylogenetic proximity, with the more basal on the left
